# AI-Powered Student Counselling Chatbot (In Planning)

## 📌 Overview
A conversational AI assistant designed to help students with academic planning, course selection, and career decisions through natural, personalized dialogue.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Answer academic queries (e.g., "What electives should I choose?")
- Suggest career paths based on interests
- Recommend relevant resources (courses, internships, etc.)

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Students often lack accessible, timely academic guidance. This chatbot aims to act as a 24/7 virtual counselor by offering tailored advice using AI.

## 🔍 Approach (Proposed)
1. *Intent Recognition*: Use NLP to understand user goals (e.g., "I want to get into data science")
2. *Dialog Management*: Manage multi-turn conversations using Rasa or a rule-based engine
3. *Recommendation Engine*: Suggest courses, career paths, or skill-building resources
4. *Optional GUI*: Interface using Streamlit or Telegram

## 📂 Potential Datasets & Knowledge Sources
- University course catalogs
- Career path guides (LinkedIn Career Explorer)
- Skills databases (ONET, Coursera)

## ⚙ Tools & Frameworks (Planned)
- Python
- Rasa / Dialogflow
- spaCy / BERT for NLP
- Streamlit or Flask for interface

## 📅 Current Status
- Designing intent map and conversation flows
- Researching dialog system frameworks
- Drafting use-cases and FAQ scenarios

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Create intents and training examples
- Build a rule-based prototype
- Test with sample student queries
